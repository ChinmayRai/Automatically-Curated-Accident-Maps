MESSAGE TO CHINMAY - 15/7:
cleaner removes redundant phrases from openie_input, this improves the performance of openie. sent_to_openie updated to use cleaner. openie_input for all months is now updated but the new outputs are not processed yet. For july2017, july_openie_input.txt contains old input and july_sent.txt contains new input. Here both the files have been left for comparison of the new sent_to_openie.py from its older version.

# we need to use the sentence selector to eliminate the negative examples of accidents news from the selected sentences. The negative examples tend to have few/no instances of verb which are important to us.

# limit the number of sentences that are marked relevant on basis of "took place" to 1.

=== implement this
