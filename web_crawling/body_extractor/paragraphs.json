Panic gripped the locality for over seven hours before the truck could be removed from the spot by the fire department. S Seetharaman, environmentalist and chemical scientist, said the city was taking a huge risk in allowing the movement of such vehicles.\\u201cThe chemicals which are transported through the city are highly hazardous. Though some tankers have been taken off the street by laying pipelines, the situation continues to be grave,\\u201d he said.According to sources with the BPCL, the number of tanker trucks with LPG bullets that passes through the city is over 100. This was after a pipeline established between the  and the IOC bottling plant in  took many as 40 such trucks off the road.C R Surendranath, former deputy chief controller of explosives, said a permanent solution is to make the IOC import terminal at  a reality.\\u201cThe transportation of LPG should be done completely via pipeline and once the import terminal becomes a reality it would result in these trucks going off the road,\\u201d said Surendranath.Seetharaman said the truck drivers should be given training. \\u201cThe drivers should know what they are handling. Apart from giving awareness to them, the trucks must be regularly inspected to avoid a possible leak,\\u201d he said.Apart from petroleum products, other hazardous chemicals are also being moved through the city.

While a 10-year-old boy died in April after his school bag snagged in the moving handrail of an escalator at the Express Avenue mall, throwing him off the second floor, a 23-year-old was injured when he jumped off the fourth floor at the Forum  last week.During a review meeting on safety in public buildings here on Thursday, district collector  told representatives of shopping malls and cinema halls to apply for the licence within the next two weeks. Officials said schools, colleges, hostels, libraries, clubs, lodging houses, boarding houses, hotels and buildings used for organising public meetings, marriages and parties must apply for the licence under the  (Licensing) Act, 1965.Noting that the act deals with safety norms in such public buildings, an official said several shopping malls in the city are ignorant of this requirement. \\u201cMany believe the structural stability certificate issued by the public works department is enough.

Pune  () said the covers had sunk due to the high velocity of vehicles which was leading to flooding of the underpass and the difference in the height of the road before and after the channel was causing accidents.Locals said the channel, which runs across both flanks of the carriageway, is used by local residents extensively for washing and other purposes. The channel is covered by standard-issue RCC covers, aligned with the level of the carriageway to ensure a smooth driving experience.Lately, those covers have caved in to the point where the water underneath overflows with part of the underpass often flooded due to the slope leading into it. Motorists have often suffered damage to their vehicles due to the sudden caving in of the covers, and accidents are common because of slippages.\\u201cHow should we drive? I can slow down here because I know what the situation is. But I know many who have suffered accidents due to the condition of the covers here, or have slipped due to the overflowing water. This has been the case for almost two-three weeks now,\\u201d said N Ramesh who drives to his shop in Vimannagar.The foul smell emanating from the channel because of the garbage and the debris dumped in it for weeks without any cleaning is suffocating.\\u201cIf the problem is not sorted now, imagine what it will be during the monsoon.

The whole project does not look like one which is important or recently completed,\\u201d Qaneez Sukhrani, convenor of the Vimannagar Citizens\\u2019 Forum, said.Civic officials admitted that the flooding and the overflow issue exist, but blamed drivers who speed down the slope towards the underpass.\\u201cThis is indeed a problem there. The RCC covers are frequently damaged which is why the water overflows and thus the quality of driving is sometimes not smooth. We have observed that because motorists speed down the carriageway using the slope, the force exerted by the vehicles on the covers damages them. We are currently changing those covers with newer ones being of more sturdy material,\\u201d a civic official in the PMC\\u2019s project department said.", "VADODARA: Two persons died in different road  on National Highway-8 near the city over the past two days.In the early hours of Tuesday, a man was found dead near  on the highway.
