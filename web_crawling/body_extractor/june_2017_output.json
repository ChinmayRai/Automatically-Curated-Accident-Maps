The corporation decided to send a notice to the contractors asking them to provide adequate trucks and clear the waste before it gets piled up leading to spread of epidemic or face termination of contract.It was a week ago that new contractor took over the responsibility of transporting waste from different parts of the city to the Brahmapuram plant. The bid for transporting biowaste was won by one contractor while another person secured the bid for transporting plastic waste from the city. Unlike the earlier system, where the remuneration was given on the basis of trips conducted by each truck supplied by the contractor, the new system fixes rate according to the weight of waste transported. \"The contractors are not providing adequate trucks. So, waste has started to pile up in the city. Though, we brought the issue to the notice of the contractors, they are yet to supply adequate trucks,\" health standing committee chairperson  said. \"Waste remains piled up in the streets.

She was 31 weeks pregnant when the accident near Gwalior left her quadriplegic. Her spine got dislocated at C4 and C5 levels and there was no movement in her hands or legs.Her survival itself was doubtful and few, including the doctors treating her at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre (ISIC), thought it would be possible to deliver the baby successfully. First, fixing the spine dislocation required a surgery that could have put the child\u2019s life at risk by precipitating early labour and premature birth. In addition, the positioning of Siddhi on the stomach for surgery, which is the norm, would pose a threat to the child.Dr H S Chhabra, chief of spine service and medical director of ISIC, said they decided to break the surgical intervention into multiple steps to avoid threat to the baby\u2019s life and save the mother too. \u201cFirst, we reduced the dislocation in the spine by skeletal traction. This was done by slowly and gently pulling on the dislocated vertebrae using weights,\u201d he explained.He said reducing the dislocation made spine surgery simpler. \u201cNow, we only needed to remove the disc between C4 and C5, put in a cage and bone graft in between and fix it with a plate so that the vertebrae were fused with each other. This could be done from front with Siddhi lying on her back,\u201d the spine surgeon said.The surgery was taken up four days later to enable Siddhi to reach 32 weeks of pregnancy to ensure better prognosis for the child even in case of premature delivery precipitated by the spine surgery. It was uneventful and gave the doctors more time to prepare for child delivery. But here was another problem. ISIC is a specialised centre for orthopaedic and spine injuries and they did not have infrastructure or expertise to deal with high risk pregnancy.Because Siddhi couldn\u2019t be shifted out either, the hospital arranged incubator, medications to prevent Post-Partum Haemorrhage (PPH) and a paediatric team from outside to deliver the baby. All precautions were taken to prevent PPH that can be massive and life threatening because many times the uterus may not contract due to neurological damage, Dr Rachna Verma, senior gynaecologist and obstetrician at ISIC, said.She added that the baby girl was delivered successfully on May 17 in the 36th week. She is healthy and normal weight. Siddhi, too, has been recovering well, the doctors added. The 30-year-old is able to move her hands and legs. Dr Chhabra said Siddhi has been put on regular physiotherapy and occupational therapy for faster recovery and she is likely to get back to normalcy in the next couple of months. Siddhi was sitting in the front seat without using her seat belt when the accident took place on April 13. Her parents, brother and one-and-a-half-year-old daughter were also in the car. In the accident, all escaped with minor injuries, but Siddhi suffered severe injuries of the spine. If Siddhi was wearing seat belt, the doctors said, damage may have been lesser.Research in the UK has shown that wearing a seat belt reduces the risk of fatal injury to front seat passengers by 45% and risk of moderate-to-critical injury by 50%. For those riding in the rear of vans and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), rear seat belts are 73% better at preventing fatalities. Also, children are likely to be safer 92% when adults in the car use seat belts.According to a WHO report, India has the highest number of  in the world (105,725 in 4 lakh accidents), followed by China (96,611), the US (42,642) and Russia (35,972).

After the Chennai Silks incident, many are thinking about making changes in structure to meet as many safety norms as possible,\u201d said the owner of a popular textile outlet in Tirupur.Several businessmen in the sector feel that while compliance with the safety norms set by the government is urgently needed, there is also a need to improvise the standard operating procedure. \u201cHuman resource department of companies should put in efforts to identify the best and plausible SOP for their company to prevent fire accidents,\u201d said the outlet owner.Managing director of Classic Polo TV Sivaram, who witnessed the Chennai fire, said, \u201cThere are two essential takeaways from the Chennai Silks episode. We should not allow food or beverages inside the showroom and fire safety equipment operated by electricity should not be linked to the main power board,\u201d he told TOI.According to Sivaram, the fire was caused due to short-circuit. \u201cIt was early in the morning when the fire broke out. All the air-conditioners were switched off and there was no one inside the building. So, the only possibility is short-circuit that could have been caused by rodents, which are attracted by food. I suggest that the pantry, cafeteria and all food consumption activities be shifted to a separate building,\u201d he said.The fire hydrant at Chennai Silks was drawing power from the building\u2019s main power board, Sivaram said. \u201cThe fire broke out from the basement, where the main power board was located. To prevent the spread of fire, people switched off the mains. Due to this, they could not use the fire hydrant. The hydrant should be operated with a separate power supply and should be given a generator connection,\u201d he added.Some textile company owners also suggest that companies should employ 24x7 security personnel trained in fire rescue operations. \u201cYou should at least have two security guards who know how to operate the hydrant and extinguishers, and also if need be, manage the evacuation process,\u201d said an entrepreneur.", "title": "Local textile bizmen learn a lesson or two from Chennai fire accident"}, {"body": "Mapusa: Two children died in two separate freak incidents on Thursday.
