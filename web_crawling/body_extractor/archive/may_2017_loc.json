Rumours had been doing the rounds that the serial would \u201csend\u201d Vikram\u2019s \u2018Anurag\u2019 abroad. \u201cNo, that can\u2019t be done. We have just shown Anurag return from the US. How can he go abroad again? We are thinking on other lines,\u201d said creative director and scriptwriter of the serial, Leena Gangopadhyay. Some viewers thought the character would die. \u201cThat is because what happened in \u2018Jol Nupur\u2019. When actors Ronnie Chakraborty and Pijush Ganguly died, they were both in the same serial, and we showed the characters, too, died But we can\u2019t do that here. With so much of media coverage, people know what\u2019s happened to Vikram,\u201d Gangopadhyay said.In fact, she reportedly planned to link events from Vikram\u2019s real life to the screenplay. \u201cIn the script, someone would break the news that Anurag had had an accident. While the car was found, he was untraceable,\u201d she said. Dialogues were being written to build the anxiety over searching Anurag. So, will the crash be shown on Rashbehari Avenue? \u201cNo, we are showing the accident on Durgapur Expressway,\u201d she said.In fact, two days after his accident, Vikram himself had apparently spoken to Gangopadhyay, expressing his apprehension if he would be able to ever work again. The question rose because he was aware of the problem of episode-banking that serial-makers faced. He knew that if an episode was not ready, there could not be a repeat telecast of an earlier episode.

Why didn\u2019t Sonika, a driver herself, not propose to drive the car if Vikram was drinking all night and allegedly driving the car at breakneck speed?3. Why was the CCTV footage from Rashbehari Avenue not taken into account to validate whether another car really came across from the other side?4. Was a blood alcohol test done on Vikram?
