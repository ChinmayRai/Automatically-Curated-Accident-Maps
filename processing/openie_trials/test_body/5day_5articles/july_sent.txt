The Monday fuel tanker accident at Kajupada has once again highlighted the need for identifying and correcting accident-prone spots on Thane roads especially on the Ghodbunder stretch that features among the most mishap prone roads. -----------. A joint commitee comprising transport department, revenue, police and public works were entrusted to identify the dangerous spots in the district and suggest corrective actions. -----------. However, nearly months after it was formed, there has been no progress on the front, informed an official, who claims that several mishaps could be avoided if certain changes are made in the road designs. -----------. As many as three spots along the Ghodbunder stretch including the Kajupada turn, Gaimukh and Chena creek one seem to be the most notorious when it comes to heavy vehicles toppling over. -----------. There have been several mishaps reported at these three bends on the stretch wherein heavy vehicles have lost balance. -----------. The recent one was on Monday at Kajupada and a TMT bus at Chena creek turn last week. -----------. Few MSRTC buses have also met with mishaps on the Gaimukh-Kajupada stretch while maneourving a turn causing them to topple. -----------. Transport activists have been long demanding that sharp bends along the ghodbunder, especially at Kajupada, Gaimukh be eased for safety of traffic movement. -----------. “Few sharp turns along the GB stretch have witnessed instances of vehicles overturning in the recent past, inform experts,” admit officials manning the stretch. -----------. Experts attribute the mishaps to mostly poor road design. -----------. “Often reckless tarring ends up changing the gradients at turns compared to what it was designed for thus posing risks for vehicles. -----------. Rampant speed breakers on highways also cause accidents and so do sharp curves especially on high speed zones like highways. -----------. The need is to ensure the norms mandated are followed,” said Nitin Dossa, executive chairman of the Western India Automobiles Association. -----------. Meanwhile, when contacted the transport department at Thane said they would work out a solution after identifying the problem spots in Thane to prevent further mishaps. -----------. “We are planning to pilot a joint meet to identify and chalk out a solution to the rising number of road accidents. -----------. There are several junctions, turns on heavy density corridors like GB that see frequent accidents and need immediate solutions,” said a transport official. -----------. The city has witnessed nearly 4,400 accidents since 2014 of and nearly 800 proved fatal. -----------.  ============.
