Two months ago, when Siddhi met with an accident while going to her maternal home, all this seemed unthinkable, the Panchkula resident added. -----------. She was 31 weeks pregnant when the accident near Gwalior left her quadriplegic. -----------. Her spine got dislocated at C4 and C5 levels and there was no movement in her hands or legs. -----------. Her survival itself was doubtful and few, including the doctors treating her at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre (ISIC), thought it would be possible to deliver the baby successfully. -----------. First, fixing the spine dislocation required a surgery that could have put the child’s life at risk by precipitating early labour and premature birth. -----------. In addition, the positioning of Siddhi on the stomach for surgery, which is the norm, would pose a threat to the child. -----------. Dr H S Chhabra, chief of spine service and medical director of ISIC, said they decided to break the surgical intervention into multiple steps to avoid threat to the baby’s life and save the mother too. -----------. “First, we reduced the dislocation in the spine by skeletal traction. -----------. This was done by slowly and gently pulling on the dislocated vertebrae using weights,” he explained. -----------. He said reducing the dislocation made spine surgery simpler. -----------. “Now, we only needed to remove the disc between C4 and C5, put in a cage and bone graft in between and fix it with a plate so that the vertebrae were fused with each other. -----------. This could be done from front with Siddhi lying on her back,” the spine surgeon said. -----------. The surgery was taken up four days later to enable Siddhi to reach 32 weeks of pregnancy to ensure better prognosis for the child even in case of premature delivery precipitated by the spine surgery. -----------. It was uneventful and gave the doctors more time to prepare for child delivery. -----------. But here was another problem. -----------. ISIC is a specialised centre for orthopaedic and spine injuries and they did not have infrastructure or expertise to deal with high risk pregnancy. -----------. Because Siddhi couldn’t be shifted out either, the hospital arranged incubator, medications to prevent Post-Partum Haemorrhage (PPH) and a paediatric team from outside to deliver the baby. -----------. All precautions were taken to prevent PPH that can be massive and life threatening because many times the uterus may not contract due to neurological damage, Dr Rachna Verma, senior gynaecologist and obstetrician at ISIC, said. -----------. She added that the baby girl was delivered successfully on May 17 in the 36th week. -----------. She is healthy and normal weight. -----------. Siddhi, too, has been recovering well, the doctors added. -----------. The 30-year-old is able to move her hands and legs. -----------. Dr Chhabra said Siddhi has been put on regular physiotherapy and occupational therapy for faster recovery and she is likely to get back to normalcy in the next couple of months. -----------. Siddhi was sitting in the front seat without using her seat belt when the accident took place on April 13. -----------. Her parents, brother and one-and-a-half-year-old daughter were also in the car. -----------. In the accident, all escaped with minor injuries, but Siddhi suffered severe injuries of the spine. -----------. If Siddhi was wearing seat belt, the doctors said, damage may have been lesser. -----------. Research in the UK has shown that wearing a seat belt reduces the risk of fatal injury to front seat passengers by 45% and risk of moderate-to-critical injury by 50%. -----------. For those riding in the rear of vans and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), rear seat belts are 73% better at preventing fatalities. -----------. Also, children are likely to be safer 92% when adults in the car use seat belts. -----------. According to a WHO report, India has the highest number of road deaths in the world (105,725 in 4 lakh accidents), followed by China (96,611), the US (42,642) and Russia (35,972). -----------. Of these deaths, 25% can be avoided by wearing seat belts. -----------.  ============. In the latest episode of Sasural Simar Ka, Vikram is driving as he recalls Anjali's words. -----------.

Money surely cannot be equated with human suffering but it can compensate as far as it can, a court noted while awarding Rs 24.39 lakh compensation to a youth who was permanently disabled in an accident last year. -----------. The diploma student was on his way to college when he met with an accident that left him 85% disabled in his lower limb, forcing him to undergo an amputation. -----------. As a result, the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT) took a compassionate view of his condition considering the possibility of what all lay in store for him. -----------. “Injuries and amputation suffered by the petitioner has also diminished his marriage prospects,” noted MACT presiding officer Madhu Jain. -----------. The tribunal also observed that “no amount of compensation could restore the physical frame of the victim”, who was 19-year-old at the time of the accident. -----------. “Therefore object to compensate such injury is so far as money can compensate because it is impossible to equate money with human suffering or personal deprivation,” the MACT said while referring to a Supreme Court judgment. -----------. On July 5, 2016 at 9am, the youth was with his brother near the main entrance of his college, when a car hit him and dragged him up to a distance. -----------. The driver claimed that the student was carelessly crossing the road and though he applied emergency brakes, he could not stop his car. -----------. The insurance company with which the car was insured tried to distance itself from the fiasco pointing out that the car was a commercial one. -----------. It, too, said it was the youth’s fault. -----------. A case was lodged against the driver for rash driving and causing grievous hurt. -----------. Medical opinion placed before MACT revealed that the youth’s condition was “non-progressive” and not likely to improve. -----------. Medical experts suggested that he could carry out 95% of his daily physical activities with an artificial limb. -----------. Consequently, the disbursal of compensation for the youngster was divided under various categories, such as pain and suffering; loss of amenities, income, earning capacity; future prospects; disfigurement and most importantly for an artificial limb and its maintenance — for which Rs 11 lakh alone was awarded. -----------. The insurance company was directed to deposit the compensation within a month from the date of the order and also file a compliance report. -----------.  ============. Speeding on their brand new sports bikes turned fatal for two — a minor and a youth — at Shastri Nagar and Mangolpuri in the past 24 hours. -----------. In both cases, the victims had lost control of the high-powered motorcycles. -----------. On Tuesday afternoon, a teenager, riding a KTM bike, lost control while performing a wheelie on the Shastri Park bridge. -----------. Mohammad Umar (15) had got the bike as a gift from his father and taken his friend Mohammad Anas out on a ride. -----------. Family members told the police that Umar had pestered his parents to buy him the bike after seeing a neighbour. -----------. However, the minor didn’t have any training to handle such a bike and lost control and slipped on the wet road. -----------. The police said he was not even wearing a helmet and died on the spot. -----------. Anas, also a Class VII student, is also critical. -----------. The police will book Umar’s father for allowing a minor to drive a vehicle without a licence. -----------. The bike was found to be registered in his name. -----------. In the night, Johnny (25) and Amit (17) were also out on a joyride on the former’s KTM bike worth Rs 2 lakh at Mangolpuri near Rohini. -----------. Near Sanjay Gandhi police station, eyewitnesses said, Johnny tried to dodge a Maruti Swift car, which was also speeding, but ended up hitting one side of the car and fell. -----------. The front wheel of the car ran over him. -----------. Johnny and Amit were first taken to Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital and then shifted to Safdurjung Hospital where the former died during treatment. -----------. Amit is still critical. -----------. The driver fled, leaving the car behind. -----------. Although locals claimed that the car had a Delhi Police cap and some files with the police logo on the dashboard and was being driven by a cop, the driver is yet to be identified. -----------. A case of causing death has been registered against the driver. -----------. The police said a bottle of alcohol was also found on the spot. -----------. Locals vandalised the car and tried to set it on fire. -----------.  ============. Life couldn’t have been more perfect for Karan Veer Mehra. -----------. His stint on television was good, and when he decided to take a break from it after 'Pavitra Rishta', to pursue films again, a role tailor-made for him fell into his lap. -----------. The actor was signed up last November 2016 by a big banner to play a hockey player in a movie — a character that would have been a cakewalk, considering the fact that he had excelled in the sport in school. -----------. However, it was not meant to be. -----------. Fate intervened in the guise of an auto rickshaw accident that left him out of action for three months. -----------. He recalls, “My life changed in December last year. -----------. I was waiting for my friends to take off to Goa on our bikes, when the three-wheeler hit me from behind. -----------. I had to undergo a foot surgery. -----------. The film required me to play a hockey player, so I had no option but to let go of the film.”The loss of the film affected Karan deeply. -----------. “The accident prolonged my wait to return to acting; after the surgery, I went back home (Delhi) for recovery and rehab. -----------. Soon, I slipped into depression and took to alcohol. -----------. I would drink and stay up the whole night. -----------. I put on kilos and lost all hope. -----------. However, one day it dawned upon me that I can’t stay away from what I love the most — acting. -----------. That’s when I decided to get back on track. -----------. My family and friends saw me through the tough phase.” Finally, things are looking up for Karan. -----------. He ended his forced sabbatical with the show 'TV, Biwi Aur Main', in which he plays a producer. -----------. “It’s an interesting take on the current state of television, where broadcasters call the shots. -----------. I also learnt how poor producers often get sandwiched between actors and the channel,” he sums up. -----------.  ============. A group of three men on Tuesday morning robbed a driver of his cab in Noida’s Sector 44. -----------. The Maruti Swift Dzire was attached with Uber, the victim said. -----------.

With the help of some passersby, Nafees informed the police control room. -----------. He later visited the Sector 39 police station and filed a case. -----------. Ajay Kumar, SHO Sector 39 police station, said a case of car loot has been registered and the matter is being investigated. -----------.  ============. Four persons, including a woman of the same family, were killed on the spot when their car collided head-on with a dumper near Dudhala village of Mahua town in Bhavnagar district on Tuesday. -----------. The victims were identified as Ashok Bhuva (35), Gangadabhai Bhuva (70), his wife Diwaliben (60) and son Jagdish (30). -----------. Ashok was also a relative of the deceased. -----------.

Police have registered an FIR against the driver of the dumper who is absconding. -----------.  ============. A 12-year-old girl died on the spot and seven others from her family were injured when the autorickshaw they were travelling by crashed into a raised platform outside a house before overturning and ramming into an electricity pole at Vetal Chowk in Kondhwa around 12.15pm on Tuesday. -----------. The autorickshaw was hurtling down the slope with its engine switched off. -----------. On December 5 last year, three senior citizens travelling by an autorickshaw had died in a similar way after the autodriver lost control over the vehicle while coming down the same slope and rammed into the wall of the same house belonging to a businessman before hitting a scooter. -----------. Police identified the deceased in Tuesday's accident as Saniya Attar, whose father Sher Khan Zamir Khan Pathan, 45, was driving the autorickshaw. -----------. Pathan's leg was fractured and he has some injuries to his eye. -----------. The injured victims were Pathan's wife Tarannum (40), their son Toufik (10) and daughters Toliya (14) and Ayesha (13), Tarannum's sister Tausim Attar (30) and the latter's five-year-old son Sohaib from Shivnerinagar. -----------. They are undergoing treatment at Sassoon General Hospital. -----------. Barring Ayesha, the conditions of the other victims was reported as serious. -----------. The family was going to a school for the admission of one of their children, police said. -----------. Tuesday's mishap has again highlighted dangerous driving by people who switch off the engines of their vehicles and ride at high speed down the slope that links Shivnerinagar with Vetal Chowk. -----------. Pathan switched off the engine on the descent. -----------. The vehicle picked up speed. -----------. He then lost control and rammed into the platform of Atul Chougule's residence. -----------. His house is close to the bungalow of former MLA Mahadev Babar.““We have booked Pathan under Section 304 (a) (causing death due to negligence) and other charges under the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act,“ Govekar said. -----------. The front and the middle portion of the autorickshaw had caved in and its front wheel had rolled out on the road. -----------. The platform was partly damaged. -----------. The police cordoned off the accident spot. -----------.

A minor girl died on the spot while others were severely injured. -----------. An ambulance from Vetal Mi tramandal was summoned.“Another resident Nilesh Mahindrakar said, “The driver applied brakes but could not control the vehicle. -----------. He hit the platform and the vehicle overturned, skidded and rammed into the electricity pole.“Chaudhari said their appeals to the civic body on several occasions to level the slope remained unheard.“Our mandal has planned to fix tyres on Chougule's boundary wall as a preventive measure. -----------. It may prevent fatal mishaps. -----------. Senior citizens sit outside on the platform,“ he said. -----------.  ============. Two labourers were killed and six injured when a truck loaded with gravel, on which they were sitting, overturned in Kapoor village on Tuesday. -----------. The truck driver steered a sharp turn when a scooter suddenly came before the vehicle. -----------. The driver lost control of the truck, following which it turned turtle in the fields. -----------.

Was IAS officer Anurag Tewari killed first and thrown before the truck parked at Meerabai Marg guest house to make the entire episode look like a hit-and-run case? -----------. Among other theories, the investigators involved with the probe have started pursuing the latest one which came to the fore earlier this week. -----------. While working on the murder case of Karnataka cadre officer of 2007 batch, the CBI questioned a truck driver who spotted Anurag’s body lying before his truck in the wee hours of May 17. -----------. A woman sweeper and this truck driver are believed to be the first two persons who saw the body before the daybreak. -----------. As panel of doctors which conducted the autopsy stood by their findings when CBI questioned them and dubbed Anurag’s death as unnatural, investigators were eagerly waiting for the viscera examination report that is to arrive from CFSL Chandigarh. -----------. While the report stands crucial to the case as it will confirm if Anurag died of lack of oxygen induced by drug overdose or poisoning, the Central agency will be compelled to strongly pursue other theories otherwise. -----------. As CCTV footage showed that the truck driver was forced to reverse the vehicle instead of going in the straight direction, he was grilled rigorously by CBI sleuths. -----------. The driver who was initially questioned by city police broke down before CBI and confessed that Anurag’s body was lying diagonally just before the truck (towards driver seat) he had no choice but the back the heavy vehicle.“Had the woman sweeper not alerted the driver about man’s body, truck driver Pradeep would have crushed him under the wheels,” said an officer involved with the probes. -----------. If forensic reports fail to confirm poisoning, the agency will be have no option but to find out whether Anurag was attacked on the intervening night and dumped on the road thereafter. -----------. Stand-off between officer’s family and city policeLucknow: Both the elder brothers of IAS officer — Alok and Mayank — were left surprised at city police’s U-turn on Anurag’s clothes. -----------. They were taken aback by TOI report on how Anurag’s clothes have gone missing. -----------. The duo had specifically asked investigating officer of the case — SHO Hazratganj Anand Shahi — to keep the clothes secured after the autopsy on May 18. -----------. And district police chief too assured them that clothes have been taken into possession by police. -----------. SSP Deepak Kumar is on leave and would be back on Sunday evening. -----------. However, Anand Shahi on Thursday told Alok that the clothes were disposed by KGMU mortuary staffers. -----------. “We suspect a very big conspiracy in the entire matter. -----------. CBI needs to examine if Lucknow police is trying to shield somebody,” said Mayank over the phone. -----------.  ============.

Expressing her outrage at the hospital management's reluctance to treat an accident victim, Bharati said, "I heard the boy's mother arguing with the hospital staff. -----------. The management kept demanding that an advance amount be paid before they could start treatment. -----------. I was shocked to see that an accident victim was being meted out such inhuman treatment. -----------. Many other patients too requested the staff to initiate treatment, but to no avail. -----------. "Pointing out that the hospital management took no heed of the helpless state of Mubarak and his mother, who had no money, Bharati added, "Police should register a complaint against the hospital in public interest. -----------. "Fathema said that the staff refused treatment to her son, despite repeated assurances that the bills would be paid once her husband arrived at the hospital. -----------.
