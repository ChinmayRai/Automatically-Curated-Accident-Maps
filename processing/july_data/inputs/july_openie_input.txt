THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Accident cases have always been on a rise over the years, but, a comparative study of the accident data in the city limits during the past few years would show that there had been an alarming surge in the number of accidents involving two-wheeler riders in 2016. -----------. As per police data, a total of 2,453 accidents were reported in the city in the year 2016 and two-wheelers were involved in as many as 2,412 accidents, as compared to 2,043 cases in 2015. -----------. This statistics shows an alarming trend considering the fact that in 2014 and 2013 only 1,872 and 1,867 two-wheelers were involved in accidents respectively. -----------. The law enforcers concerned with traffic have reasons to believe that the changing attitude of two-wheeler riders could be a reason for the sudden increase in the number of accident cases. -----------. The condition of roads in the city has improved over these years, and this has resulted in riders showing a tendency to increase speed. -----------. According to V Ajith, superintendent, traffic (South Zone), the rise in accidents could be attributed to the attitude of the riders.“A quick look at the data would show that it was mostly youngsters, who were involved in most of the accidents,” the SP said. -----------. With the road conditions improving, they too show tendency to rev up their vehicles, which eventually would result in accidents.“The feedback we often receive during our awareness campaigns in schools is that teenagers always prefer motorcycles with high-power engines. -----------. Even if their parents suggest safer options, they won’t approve,” the SP said. -----------. Parents, out of love towards their wards, would eventually buy them the bikes they desire. -----------. But, what they don’t realize is that such powerful vehicles in inexperienced hands mean danger. -----------. The SP also said that he has directed the officials concerned to prepare a list of accident victims based on their age. -----------. Available data shows that most of the two-wheeler accidents reported last year occurred on open stretches. -----------. Karamana–Pravachambalam highway stretch would lead the table. -----------. Other accident hotspots include Vellayani, Kuzhivila, Muttathara, Kochu Veli and Pachalloor. -----------. All these spots have witnessed multiple accidents recently. -----------.  ============.  +++++++++++++++++++.

While one animal died on the spot, the other sustained severe injuries. -----------. A police patrol reached the spot and alerted the control room. -----------. Police sources stated the cops struggled to seek help from local animal welfare organizations. -----------.

Mire, too, had a tough time arranging for transportation and medical treatment for the cattle. -----------. “Only around 11am, the civic body sent the hydraulic ambulance and we took the injured animal to Gorakshan Sabha in Dhantoli. -----------. The animal got treatment 12 hours after the accident,” Mire said. -----------. However on Monday morning, the other animal also succumbed to the injuries. -----------.

The Monday fuel tanker accident at Kajupada has once again highlighted the need for identifying and correcting accident-prone spots on Thane roads especially on the Ghodbunder stretch that features among the most mishap prone roads. -----------. A joint commitee comprising transport department, revenue, police and public works were entrusted to identify the dangerous spots in the district and suggest corrective actions. -----------. However, nearly months after it was formed, there has been no progress on the front, informed an official, who claims that several mishaps could be avoided if certain changes are made in the road designs. -----------. As many as three spots along the Ghodbunder stretch including the Kajupada turn, Gaimukh and Chena creek one seem to be the most notorious when it comes to heavy vehicles toppling over. -----------. There have been several mishaps reported at these three bends on the stretch wherein heavy vehicles have lost balance. -----------. The recent one was on Monday at Kajupada and a TMT bus at Chena creek turn last week. -----------. Few MSRTC buses have also met with mishaps on the Gaimukh-Kajupada stretch while maneourving a turn causing them to topple. -----------. Transport activists have been long demanding that sharp bends along the ghodbunder, especially at Kajupada, Gaimukh be eased for safety of traffic movement. -----------. “Few sharp turns along the GB stretch have witnessed instances of vehicles overturning in the recent past, inform experts,” admit officials manning the stretch. -----------. Experts attribute the mishaps to mostly poor road design. -----------. “Often reckless tarring ends up changing the gradients at turns compared to what it was designed for thus posing risks for vehicles. -----------. Rampant speed breakers on highways also cause accidents and so do sharp curves especially on high speed zones like highways. -----------. The need is to ensure the norms mandated are followed,” said Nitin Dossa, executive chairman of the Western India Automobiles Association. -----------. Meanwhile, when contacted the transport department at Thane said they would work out a solution after identifying the problem spots in Thane to prevent further mishaps. -----------. “We are planning to pilot a joint meet to identify and chalk out a solution to the rising number of road accidents. -----------. There are several junctions, turns on heavy density corridors like GB that see frequent accidents and need immediate solutions,” said a transport official. -----------. The city has witnessed nearly 4,400 accidents since 2014 of and nearly 800 proved fatal. -----------.  ============.

In a grim reminder of the danger posed by barricades placed by traffic cops on the city streets, a 38-year-old man died on the spot after his two-wheeler rammed into a set of metal drums intended to regulate traffic near the Melmaruvathur bypass road on Tuesday morning. -----------. Police said Loganathan was on his way to visit relatives, along with his wife Poongothai, 35, when he lost control of the two-wheeler and crashed into the barricade placed in the middle of the road. -----------. Poongothai suffered injuries and is being treated at a private hospital. -----------. Barricades have caused several accidents in the city, although traffic police say that they are placed to minimise accidents by preventing overspeeding. -----------. In the absence of standard bollards or barricades, police use abandoned drums and rusted sheets welded to metal frames, endangering motorists. -----------. Though the traffic police have removed many of the drums, they are still used in several parts of the city. -----------. Adyar traffic police personnel said that they have been instructed to remove the drums and use standard barricades instead. -----------. V Kumar, a resident of Palavakkam and a regular commuter on the ECR, said, “There are at least 14 barricades placed between Thiruvanmiyur and Muttukadu. -----------. At least four people have been killed in this manner along this stretch in the last few months.”There have been several incidents of tanker lorries ramming into barricades on the Manali stretch. -----------. Two months ago, a policeman lost his life when a tanker lorry rammed into him while trying to avoid a barricade. -----------. V Balaji, a resident of Kasimedu, said, “There is poor lighting where the barricades are kept near the Kasimedu fishing harbour and when the youngsters speed here, they do not see the barricades in the dark and crash into them. -----------. The traffic police and civic authorities should ensure proper lighting to avoid such deaths.”“Most of the victims who crash into these barricades are youngsters who overspeed on their two-wheelers. -----------. Many do not wear helmets leading to severe injuries or deaths,” said a traffic policeman attached to the Adyar traffic investigation wing. -----------.  ============.

Huda will revamp the junction on Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) near St Xavier’s School to provide relief to residents of the city’s new sectors along SPR who have to negotiate the accident-prone spot daily. -----------. The divider on the SPR at the junction, near St Xavier’s School, is not aligned with the road coming from Sector 49/50 and Sector 65/66, causing traffic jams and accidents. -----------. Due to the jutting extension of the divider on SPR, people coming from Sector 65/66 have to take an extended U-turn to go to Golf Course Road, often leading to head-on collisions, because of which residents have been demanding the junction be redesigned. -----------. TOI had highlighted the problem in March.“The estimate for improving the junction has been approved. -----------. We’re inviting tenders. -----------. Work is likely to start by month-end,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav, adding the project will reduce jams and ensure smooth flow of traffic at the junction. -----------. It will cost around Rs 31 lakh. -----------. Several residential and commercial projects are coming up along SPR. -----------. Thousands of people have already moved into these new sectors, resulting in sharp rise in traffic volumes. -----------. “The junction has emerged as an accident spot due to faulty design,” said Sachin Sharma, resident of Sector 50. -----------. Residents of the area had another long-standing grouse — the presence of high-tension towers on a sector road of Sector 65/66. -----------. It was resolved when the high-tension towers were shifted in April. -----------. Sector 66 resident Prabhat Mishra said shifting of the high-tension line has ensured smooth traffic flow, and that they are hoping the authority will complete the new work at the earliest. -----------. “With rise in traffic in the area, the junction is permanently choked. -----------. The promised work will help ease traffic congestions,” said Mishra. -----------. Along with improvement at the junction, Huda is also building master roads of the area to improve connectivity of the sectors. -----------. “We are making all efforts to improve the infrastructure and connectivity of new sectors,” said Yadav. -----------.  ============. The number of fatalities in road accidents across the state has gone up by 10%, says a report by the Tamil Nadu police submitted to the secretariat on Thursday. -----------.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has sent a proposal to the Central government seeking Rs 114 crore to lay a new road at Thoppur ghat section on Salem-Bangalore national highway. -----------. The project is expected to check accidents in the busy stretch. -----------. Thousands of vehicles, including trucks, use the 3.5 km stretch a day to reach Kerala via Coimbatore or Kanyakumari. -----------. It is also a popular route to the northern and western parts of India. -----------. According to NHAI officials, on an average, 13 accidents take place a month on the ghat road. -----------. They blamed rash driving for the accidents. -----------. “Most of the trucks are loaded with goods more than the stipulated weight. -----------. They topple while crossing the hairpin bends at the ghat road,” a NHAI official told TOI. -----------. To check such incidents, NHAI and the Dharmapuri district administration had jointly conducted a field study, which identified accident prone spots. -----------. The district administration then approached the forest department to allocate land to lay the new road, which will eliminate hairpin bends.“We have decided to lay the new road without hairpin bends and sharp curves,” the official said. -----------. The road will be 60 ft wide with centre median. -----------. It will start from Kattamedu, the entry point of Thoppur ghat road and end at Thoppur village. -----------. NHAI also plans to save trees that have to be cut down for the road expansion work. -----------. “We will uproot trees using earthmovers and will plant them in the nearby forest,” the official said.“We hope the Central government will release the fund in a couple of months,” he added. -----------.  ============.

An incident that started as a spat over a truck grazing against a car turned into an ugly fight with suspected cow vigilantes thrashing not only the truck drivers, but also animal transporters in seven other vehicles. -----------. The mob vandalised the vehicles at Baba Haridass Nagar on Friday night and released the animals on the road.“The argument at Jharoda village about our truck scraping an i10 car turned ugly when the four men in the car accused us of transporting cattle illegally. -----------. What could we do when confronted by 50 people?” said Shaukeen Khan, 25, a resident of Nangloi. -----------. “We had 17 buffalo calves in our Bolero, which we were taking to Ghazipur to sell having purchased them in villages near Meham in Haryana. -----------. We did not have any papers with us. -----------. There are usually no transaction papers for purchases we make in rural areas.”The mob then went after all vehicles carrying buffalos, stopping and attacking seven of them going towards Ghazipur from areas like Meham, Jhajjar and Dadri in Haryana. -----------. No one has been arrested, though MN Tiwari, DCP (Outer) said that a case had been registered under the Indian Penal Code for causing hurt, theft and criminal conspiracy. -----------. “Three persons who sustained some injuries were examined and released from hospital. -----------. We are trying to establish what really took place,” said Tiwari. -----------. Khan pulled up his shirt to show injuries on his back, alleging that he and his friends had been beaten with iron rods after behind hemmed in by over 80 youngsters. -----------. “Some of them tried to inflame passions by saying we were carrying cows when they could see the animals were clearly buffalo calves,” recalled another victim, Saddam Hussain. -----------. One of the vehicles belonged to Ali Jaan, 40, of Dasna in Ghaziabad. -----------. He suffered face injuries and two fractures on his arm and had to be admitted to Rao Tula Ram Hospital, from where he was released later. -----------. Raees Khan, his face also swollen, angrily said, “We are not doing anything illegal but constantly fear for our lives.”The victims claimed they were unable to call for help because the assaulters snatched their phones, wallets and car papers. -----------. Around 90 animals were released by the mob, and only a few had been recovered by Saturday. -----------. Some died after being injured in the melee. -----------. “Each truck owner lost around Rs 3 lakh due to the lost animals, cash theft and car damages,” said Kalu Ram, who lives in Charkhi Dadri.“We know cattle transporters have been attacked in many places in Haryana, but this is the first time something this serious happened to us in Delhi,” said a terrified Saddam Hussain, son of Ali Jaan, who was the most brutally thrashed among the transporters on Friday night. -----------. When Jaan saw the upturned trucks at Jharoda village, he told Hussain and his cousin Dilshad to hurry out and hide. -----------. Jaan ended up being tied and beaten with iron rods and sticks along with 12 others. -----------. He suffered a broken arm and multiple facial injuries. -----------. Traders usually bypass the Tikri border and prefer driving through Jharoda village. -----------. “We were only trying to save money because we are forced to pay Rs 1,000 to MCD officials and police at the border crossing,” said Shaukeen Khan. -----------. The cattle traders buy and transport non-milch buffaloes or male calves from various Haryana villages in Meham, Jhajjhar, Dadri and Sampla to sell them at the livestock market near the Ghazipur abbatoir. -----------. “These are animals the farmers want to sell legally to us,” pointed out Raees Khan, who lost buffaloes worth over Rs 70,000. -----------. Some of the villagers at the attack site blamed the “animal peddlers” for inhumane treatment of the animals and said that “they had it coming”. -----------. According to eyewitnesses, some women tried to intervene and pleaded with the youngsters to stop thrashing the transporters, but were pushed aside. -----------. The seven Tat 407 mini trucks and Maxicabs were carrying over 80 calves and buffaloes. -----------.  ============.

The traffic department may be gloating over tables and graphs suggesting ‘decline’ in traffic deaths in Rajasthan, but on Saturday, dumper trucks snuffed out four lives in two separate accidents in Churu and Jaipur and left many families devastated in their bloody trail. -----------.

In a shocking incident, a total of 52 motor accident compensation case bundles have gone missing from six small causes courts located on Madras high court campus. -----------. Interestingly, all 52 bundles belong to one advocate, which indicates professional rivalry among lawyers, as well as collusion among lawyers, court officials and brokers thriving in 'accident compensation' cases. -----------. "All the bundles belong to one advocate, and the cases were pending in the first six small causes courts functioning on the Madras high court campus," a court officer told TOI, adding that several court officials, some of them on judicial side, have been issued memo. -----------. "But the real problem is reconstructing the case bundles which looks impossible, as the cases were in different stages of hearing. -----------. It is a clear subversion of judicial process," he said. -----------. Chennai has six small causes courts, besides two special courts, for motor accident claims cases. -----------. A total of about 8,500 new cases are filed every year in these courts. -----------. At present, each court is burdened with anywhere between 2,000 and 3,000 cases. -----------. That explains why the case bundles are kept under lock, and are treated like trash by bench clerks and those assisting them. -----------. But, the loss of 52 case bundles belonging to one advocate, that too from six different courts, have left the entire subordinate Bar in a daze and judicial officers in utter embarrassment. -----------. So much so that now a couple of court halls are locked even during lunch breaks. -----------. Also, lawyers who used to go near the podium and physically verify case bundles, have been barred from going anywhere near the stack. -----------. The bundle theft is also attributed to 'misunderstanding' among lawyers, police personnel and brokers over sharing of the compensation amount in specific cases. -----------. It is common knowledge in motor accident claims tri bunal circles that the top 10 lawyers dealing in such cases have a big network of brokers, and they also keep police stations in good humour by paying even advance money ranging from `2 lakh to `3 lakh.“It is not possible to independently walk into a police station and come out with all relevant papers, unless we are assisted by the brokers who are always present in police stations, or lawyers `attached' to such stations,“ said a veteran lawyer. -----------. Once an ac cident is reported, it is the broker and these lawyers who get the tip-off from police. -----------. If a different advocate enters the scene, he is not given even a copy of the FIR which would be flaunted by the broker. -----------. The station lawyer-broker duo would then directly approach the victims and offer money to take up the case.““Road accident victims are entitled to `1lakh compensation from the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. -----------. Police would require to get endorsements from victim's family , tahsildhar and district collector to claim the dole. -----------. And this formality would be endlessly delayed if the case is not han dled by `station lawyers'.“About 90% of cases go only to `station lawyers',“ said a lawyer. -----------. Rivalry over bagging accident cases has now spilled over to courts, and resulted in bundle theft, too. -----------. One solution being offered by lawyers to smash the broker menace in police stations, is to bring the traffic investigation wing too under intelligence section (IS) scrutiny.“At present only crime and law and order police are under IS radar. -----------. If traffic investigation wing too is monitored by IS, it would reduce the scourge to a large extent,“ he said. -----------.  ============. As many as two people, including a five-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, died while another person was critical after a container truck toppled on them in Hapur on Sunday. -----------.

City schools have asked the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights not to hold them responsible for school buses being involved in accidents and direct them to pay compensation. -----------. The issue was raised in a workshop organized by the commission, traffic police and the State Transport Authority (STA) on Friday. -----------. The authorities, however, pointed out that since Safe Transportation Policy for Students (STRAPS) defines the responsibility of schools, they are to be held responsible as they enter into a contract with transporters. -----------. But the schools were not impressed. -----------. Independent Schools Association president H S Mamik submitted a representation to the commission. -----------. He said, “Schools do not have technical knowledge to check if buses are in the required conditions. -----------. We can only ensure the buses are checked regularly by the STA. -----------. In case of accidents, the driver should be held responsible not the school. -----------. The schools too want safety of children but we are educators, not transporters.“He also demanded that the commission should not monitor the schools for buses as they were given this responsibility only once. -----------. “We can't be reporting to three authorities (STA, Traffic and Commission),“ he told TOI. -----------. ABS Sidhu, director-principal, Saupins schools and vice-president, ISA, said, “Schools are responsible for ensuring that the buses are manned by qualified personnel and they can ensure this by regularly checking. -----------. The same goes for buses and the equipment installed therein, but they cannot be held responsibleliable for incidental acts of commission or commission of those actually operating the buses.“Jasdeep Kalra, director, AKSIPS, said, “The core competency of a school is teaching. -----------. Monitoring traf fic, checking on bus drivers and conductors is the primary duty of the police and the STA. -----------. How on earth can one hold the principal or the management responsible for an act of omission done by a staff member outside the school premises. -----------. In case the school has deliberately not followed the law, then yes it can be held accountable.“Schools shared that they have been trying to meet expectations but the authorities need to help them further by providing guidance. -----------. Pooja Prakash, principal, KBDAV School, Sector 7, said, “We have been trying to match up to the expectations of the police, the commission and the STA. -----------. We may falter but in the end the intention is always to support the learner and remain accountable. -----------. The STA has been supportive. -----------. I am personally looking forward to some guidance from the authorities over issues like mesh over the bus window and non-combustible seat covers in school buses.“Harjinder Kaur, chairperson, commission, said “It is the duty of the school management to make arrangements to check the quality of buses and the manpower handling those buses as well as requisite quality of mandatory equipment as per the laid down parameters“. -----------. The commission, however, has decid ed to take up the matter seeking justification from schools and arrive at a logical conclusion after interacting with them. -----------. Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) had recently asked Mount Carmel School to pay Rs 75,000 to two students hurt in a bus accident. -----------. State Transport Authority (STA) additional secretary Rajiv Tewari said, “Parents send their wards in the bus because it has the school's name. -----------. They trust the school and STRAPS and CBSE too makes them responsible for school buses. -----------. So, they cannot run away .““If schools cannot shoulder responsibility, they should also stay away from collecting transport fees and earning commissions. -----------. They just let PTAs manage the transport contracts and payments. -----------. Also, the high court has categorically held that school principal is responsible for compliance of safety measures in school transport,“ said Nitin Goyal, president, Chandigarh Parents Association. -----------.  ============.

How did Subhas Chandra Bose die? -----------. To find the answer, the Indian government had appointed three commissions. -----------. The Shah Nawaz Committee (1956) and Khosla Commission (1970) said that Bose died in an aircrash on August 18, 1945 at Taihoku airport in Japanese-occupied Taipei, while the Mukherjee Commission (1999) concluded that he did not die in an air-crash. -----------. The government, however, rejected the findings of the Mukherjee Commission. -----------. But that didn’t stop scholars from dwelling deep to find the truth. -----------. Paris-based historian J B P More, who recently stumbled upon a brief French secret service report dated December 11, 1947 at the National Archives of France, has come up with a finding that Bose didn’t die in an air crash and was still alive in 1947. -----------. “It is not stated in the document that Subhas Chandra Bose died in the air crash in Taiwan. -----------. Instead, it is reported that Bose’s present whereabouts were unknown as late as December 1947, which again implies that the French did not buy the theory that Bose died in the air-crash on August 18, 1945,” said More, who teaches at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Economiques et Commerciales, Paris. -----------. The gist of the matter for the French secret service, according to More, is that Bose did not die in the air crash on August 18, 1945, as commonly held. -----------. “But he escaped from Indochina alive and his whereabouts were unknown as late as December 11, 1947, as reported in the secret document. -----------. This implies that he was alive somewhere but not dead in 1947,” said More, quoting the report written for the “Haut Commisariat de France for Indochina”- SDECE -Indochinese Base - BCRI - Number 4128/3 cs/ah - Ex Number 6/16, under the title: “Archival Information on Subhas Chandra Bose.” “In this report, it is clearly stated that he was the exchief of the Indian Independence League and a member of Hikari Kikan, a Japanese organisation. -----------. It is further stated clearly that he escaped from Indochina, though it does not state how,” he said. -----------. The British and the Japanese too declared that Bose died in an air crash after he took off from Saigon on his way to Tokyo. -----------. But the French government had always been silent on the issue, though Vietnam/Indochina was a French colony during the 1940s. -----------. So the findings of More attain significance. -----------. “Very quickly after the Japanese debacle and surrender on 15th August 1945, the French arrived in Saigon, along with British troops and took charge of Saigon. -----------. But unfortunately they left no direct accounts of Bose’s death in the air crash. -----------. They had never endorsed the theory that Bose died in the crash,” said More. -----------.  ============.

It is common enough to see cars in the city driving in a direction prohibited on that width of the road. -----------. Most streets in Delhi allow traffic to move in opposite directions on either side of the central divider. -----------. But often enough, the bunching up of traffic due to the traffic lights or a vehicle breaking down sends scores driving illegally on the wrong side of the divider. -----------. According to a traffic police study, almost 30% of road accidents are caused by this dangerous convenience of driving into oncoming traffic. -----------. Though the cops have already booked 1,53,891 drivers till date, they admit that it is a losing game. -----------. When TOI caught Suresh Kumar (name changed) a school van driver, driving on the wrong side on Mall Road near Delhi University with around 10 children in his Maruti Eeco recently, he pleaded that driving a few metres on the prohibited lane saved him fuel. -----------. “There are no U-turns till Chhatra Marg and it is easier for me drive this way for a few metres,” said Kumar, rather unapologetically. -----------. Such expediency can prove fatal. -----------. In March, four people were severely injured when the BMW car  rammed into four vehicles while driving on the wrong side near RK Puram. -----------. The driver explained that he was in a hurry to reach his destination and had lost control of the speeding car while trying to avoid autorickshaws parked by the roadside. -----------. What aggravates the problem is the city’s usual disregard for traffic rules and road etiquette. -----------. Drivers use every ruse in a me-first frenzy on the streets. -----------. Given this on-road belligerence, the traffic cops make only feeble attempts to impose discipline, like identifying 14 roads last year and deploying special teams to check motorists driving on the wrong side. -----------. Police officers say that stretches with no central verge and ones pitted with holes or prone to traffic jams see the most cases of wrong-side driving. -----------. “The civic bodies and PWD must ensure that road dividers near the exits of colonies have adequate gaps to allow vehicles to cross,” advised road expert KK Kapila. -----------. “Delhi Police must also start surveillance on marked stretches, including those near markets and malls, especially during weekends and peak school hours.”Explaining why people look for easy ways out of congestions, Kapila pointed out, “It is said that six years of a city resident’s life is spent in traffic snarls. -----------. Gridlocks cost seven million man hours and Rs 100 crore in productivity every year.”Delhi Police has sought the permission of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety to seize licences for such violations. -----------. Currently, traffic police can recommend suspension or cancellation of licences to the transport department, which then sends a notice to the offender for the surrender of the licence. -----------. Mostly, however, the notices remained un-served. -----------. Even when asked to physically present themselves with the licence at a local transport office, violators often ignore the orders. -----------. A licence is considered valid so long as it is in the possession of the holder. -----------.  ============. A bus ferrying Amarnath passengers that fell into the gorge in Ramban district of J&K has claimed 16 pilgrims, including three from Rajasthan. -----------. Among those injured 4 pilgrims of the state were also there. -----------. TOI on Sunday spoke to Manoj, senior superintendent of police, relief work, Jammu and Kashmir to know about those killed and injured in the mishap. -----------. “As per the list, the deceased from various parts of Rajasthan included Ram Karan Sharma, a native of Kanota in Jaipur, Shailendra Singh a native of Deeru village of Bharatpur and Sheeshpal Saini, a native of Nawalgarh in Jhunjhunu district of the state,” Manoj said. -----------. In the same incident those who were injured and belonged to Rajasthan included Tara Chand, Danesh Kumar, Gauri Shankar Sharma, Hari Om Sharma and Shishu Pal, he added. -----------. Officials from Jammu and Kashmir were on the job of coordinating with various state police and families of the victims to send the mortal remains of those killed in the incident. -----------. “The families will probably get the mortal remains by Monday onwards. -----------. We are in touch with the families and local police,” said an officer. -----------. Local administration rushed to the families in Bharatpur and other parts of the state to faciliate the early arrival of the mortal remains. -----------. Gauri Shankar another injured from Bharatpur recalling the incident, said, “ “The bus after covering 150 kms of travel had fallen into the gorge. -----------. After that I was fell unconscious for some time and when I woke up I was surrounded by the rescue team.” -----------.  ============.  +++++++++++++++++++. A 60-year-old man was killed on the spot and his relative suffered severe injuries, when the two-wheeler on which the two were travelling, was knocked down by a private bus in Othakadai Junction on the outskirts of the city on Sunday. -----------.

The duo who came to Madurai, were on their way back to Sivaganga, when they were knocked down. -----------. Based on a complaint from the victims’ relative, Rengasamy, a case was registered with the Othakadai police station. -----------. The bus driver P Kannan, 45, of Thirupachethi in Sivaganga district was arrested under various Sections of IPC for rash and negligent driving and causing death by negligence. -----------. Incidentally, a route bus belonging to the same company was involved in an accident due to rash and negligent driving in Ring Road at Mandela Nagar, three months ago. -----------. Over 20 passengers were injured when the bus bound to Kamuthi in Ramanathapuram, plunged into a pit. -----------. Commuters say that private buses are becoming a menace on the road due to rash and negligent driving by their drivers. -----------. “Seeing the buses itself creates panic among the commuters, especially in rural areas and on the city outskirts, where they drive recklessly without caring much about the lives of other road users,” said K Sanjeev Kumar, a regular to the city from Tirumangalam. -----------. This is second accident involving private buses in the last 15 days. -----------. Barely a couple of weeks ago, an elderly couple from the city were mowed to death by a private bus in front of the Tirumangalam bus terminal. -----------. Chandran, 60, from Vilachery and his wife Jothi, 52, were returning home on June 2 night when the accident took place. -----------.  ============. A sessions court here has convicted and sentenced a truck driver from Chaskaman in Khed to eight years’ rigorous imprisonment for an accident that killed four persons, injured four others and damaging seven vehicles in Lonikand on the Pune-Ahmednagar highway on March 25, 2012. -----------. The driver was found guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. -----------. In a judgment on Monday, additional sessions judge S M Menjoge also held the accused Somnath Ganpat Muluk (47) guilty of an offence under Section 308 (attempt for culpable homicide) in relation to the injured victims. -----------. “The court ruled that these sentences are to run concurrently,” additional public prosecutor Rajesh Kavediya told TOI. -----------. Kavediya said, “Muluk has been in jail ever since the day of the accident when he was apprehended by people and handed over to the police. -----------. The court had earlier rejected Muluk’s bail plea. -----------. Truck owner Balasaheb Vitthal Pokharkar too was arrested in the case. -----------. The court has directed the prosecution to file a separate charge sheet against Pokharkar considering that he has been absconding ever since he secured a bail after the police filed a charge sheet.”Judge Menjoge referred to “consistent and corroborative evidence by the prosecution witnesses” while ruling that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Muluk was driving the truck at a very high speed and caused death and injury besides damage to vehicles and property. -----------. “The accused was not holding a valid driving license to drive a 10-wheeler heavy goods vehicle. -----------. He was driving the truck in the speed of 70kmph to 80kmph even on the speed breaker. -----------. It is not just a case of rash and negligent driving but, the act of accused is squarely covered under Section 304-II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code,” the judge ruled. -----------. The judge further observed, “He (the accused) was having knowledge of his act that by such driving of heavy truck without license and in high speed could be harmful to other persons and property. -----------. Four persons died. -----------. It amounts to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.” In fact, one of the injured victims lost his wife and one-year-old daughter, the court pointed out. -----------. The girl, Priya Chavan, was killed on the spot while her mother, Pratibha, died at a hospital in Pune. -----------. Her husband Sundar, a carpenter by profession, was badly injured. -----------. Sundar had shifted to Lonikand from his native place in Uttar Pradesh in search of employment. -----------. Muluk’s lawyer S Kolhatkar had prayed for a lenient view as against Kavediya’s plea for maximum punishment as per the law. -----------. However, judge Menjoge held, “Considering the death of four persons and injuries to four person and damage to seven vehicles because of the accused, he is not entitled for lenient view.” -----------.  ============.

By then, their entire car was caught up in flames and a car parked beside it too was caught up in fire. -----------. However, a passer-by had informed Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services (VFES). -----------. Chauhan said that after the fire fighters came, the fire in both the cars was doused in about 30 minutes.“If the policemen in PCR van would have given us the fire extinguishers, the fire might not have been doused but at least we could have brought it under control and saved the other car too,” Chauhan told TOI. -----------.  ============.
