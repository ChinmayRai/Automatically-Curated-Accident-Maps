Aman told them that Nishan was hospitalized on March 31 after being in an accident involving ‘acid’, she said. He was declared  on April 7.“Till date no company official has bothered to inform us about it,” said Rajbir. The family has now appealed to Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj for help and also sought compensation since the family has no earning hand now. “We didn’t see him for the past three years. My mother wants to cremate her son with her own hands,” said Rajbir.She said Nishan had not visited home after he left for Saudi Arabia as he did not get leave. Meanwhile, rights activist Jas Uppal of UK-based Justice Upheld said Rajbir had contacted her seeking an investigation into her brother’s death. said a colleague of Nishan, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, said he was working as a driver in the factory and was expected to do ‘other work’. “He claims that Nishan was working the night shift from 10pm to 6am during which he was handling a large container of hot cement, which leaked,” said she said."
