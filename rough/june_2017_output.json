She was 31 weeks pregnant when the accident near Gwalior left her quadriplegic. Her spine got dislocated at C4 and C5 levels and there was no movement in her hands or legs.Her survival itself was doubtful and few, including the doctors treating her at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre (ISIC), thought it would be possible to deliver the baby successfully. First, fixing the spine dislocation required a surgery that could have put the child\u2019s life at risk by precipitating early labour and premature birth. In addition, the positioning of Siddhi on the stomach for surgery, which is the norm, would pose a threat to the child.Dr H S Chhabra, chief of spine service and medical director of ISIC, said they decided to break the surgical intervention into multiple steps to avoid threat to the baby\u2019s life and save the mother too. \u201cFirst, we reduced the dislocation in the spine by skeletal traction. This was done by slowly and gently pulling on the dislocated vertebrae using weights,\u201d he explained.He said reducing the dislocation made spine surgery simpler. \u201cNow, we only needed to remove the disc between C4 and C5, put in a cage and bone graft in between and fix it with a plate so that the vertebrae were fused with each other. This could be done from front with Siddhi lying on her back,\u201d the spine surgeon said.The surgery was taken up four days later to enable Siddhi to reach 32 weeks of pregnancy to ensure better prognosis for the child even in case of premature delivery precipitated by the spine surgery. It was uneventful and gave the doctors more time to prepare for child delivery. But here was another problem. ISIC is a specialised centre for orthopaedic and spine injuries and they did not have infrastructure or expertise to deal with high risk pregnancy.Because Siddhi couldn\u2019t be shifted out either, the hospital arranged incubator, medications to prevent Post-Partum Haemorrhage (PPH) and a paediatric team from outside to deliver the baby. All precautions were taken to prevent PPH that can be massive and life threatening because many times the uterus may not contract due to neurological damage, Dr Rachna Verma, senior gynaecologist and obstetrician at ISIC, said.She added that the baby girl was delivered successfully on May 17 in the 36th week. She is healthy and normal weight. Siddhi, too, has been recovering well, the doctors added. The 30-year-old is able to move her hands and legs. Dr Chhabra said Siddhi has been put on regular physiotherapy and occupational therapy for faster recovery and she is likely to get back to normalcy in the next couple of months. Siddhi was sitting in the front seat without using her seat belt when the accident took place on April 13. Her parents, brother and one-and-a-half-year-old daughter were also in the car. In the accident, all escaped with minor injuries, but Siddhi suffered severe injuries of the spine. If Siddhi was wearing seat belt, the doctors said, damage may have been lesser.Research in the UK has shown that wearing a seat belt reduces the risk of fatal injury to front seat passengers by 45% and risk of moderate-to-critical injury by 50%. For those riding in the rear of vans and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), rear seat belts are 73% better at preventing fatalities. Also, children are likely to be safer 92% when adults in the car use seat belts.According to a WHO report, India has the highest number of  in the world (105,725 in 4 lakh accidents), followed by China (96,611), the US (42,642) and Russia (35,972).

A contractor hired by Lucknow Electric Supply Administration (Lesa) dug up deep pits (5x7-feet) on both sides of Kanpur Road to construct underground duct to lay electricity cables, but he left the site without covering the pits. The road cutting has also damaged water supply lines and optical cables meant for telecommunication on Kanpur Road.Locals say the area may get waterlogged during rains if road is not restored timely. Alambagh Vyapar Mandal president  said, \"The contractor dug up this patch overnight but didn't bother to lay cables or restore road even after two months passed. There are more than 500 registered shops on this stretch. But without informing us, the contractor cut the road overnight. Now, because of a huge trench in front of our shops, customers have stopped coming here.There are over a dozen residential localities on both sides of the road. Besides inconvenience to commuters, most of the houses are not getting proper water supply. Amrudahibagh resident Rajneesh Khare said, \"Water supply pipeline to my house broke because of careless road-cutting by the contractor and we didn't get supply for 15 days in a row and when after repeated complaints, he fixed the pipeline, the repair was so inept that it is still leaking. We get poor less supply because of constant leakage.\" There are several other families whose supply got snapped because of road-cutting. Many offices have also suffered communication breakdown because of damaged optical fibres. Some got the damage fixed, while others have asked the contractor to get it repaired. A resident of the area  said, \"Whenever we ask the contractor, he is unable to tell us as to when he would be able to complete the work. He is doing it in bits and pieces while the entire population around Kanpur Road is facing difficulties.\" Lesa officials said they had to remove overhead electricity cables on Kanpur Road and lay them afresh in underground ducts from Amausi airport to Charbagh since it's a Metro route now. Chief engineer  said, \"To lay cables underground, contractor has to cut the road. We cannot say when this work will be over as it's a long patch. But we have instructed the contractor to do complete work in phases.
