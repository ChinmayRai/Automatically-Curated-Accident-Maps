A six-month-old girl was orphaned after her entire family - parents and elder brother - died in an accident on Sunday evening. -----------.

As soon as he stopped, a silver Santro car rammed the bicycle, flinging the family onto the other side of the median. -----------. The incident took place in outer Delhi's Narela when the family was going to buy medicines for the baby as she was suffering from viral fever. -----------. Police say all three sustained fatal head injuries. -----------. The car's driver was later arrested, but released on bail. -----------.

CCTV footage from the area was also scanned and the car's driver, Shiv Kumar, was arrested from his house. -----------. His car was seized by the cops. -----------.

After battling for life for four days, 12-year-old Vatsal Yadav, who was injured in an accident while returning home from school on Saturday, succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday night at Artemis Hospital. -----------. Vatsal, a Class VII student of St Michael's Senior Secondary School in Shivpuri, was severely injured on Saturday when he, along with his cousins, was returning home to Dhanwas village in a school cab hired by Vatsal's parents. -----------.

Actor Vikram Chatterjee’s fans are a worried lot: they are not only distressed about his health but also apparently concerned about the fate of his character in the popular serial, ‘Ichche Nodi’, not sure if Anurag, as the protagonist is called, would be removed from the story altogether. -----------. Rumours had been doing the rounds that the serial would “send” Vikram’s ‘Anurag’ abroad. -----------. “No, that can’t be done. -----------. We have just shown Anurag return from the US. -----------. How can he go abroad again? -----------. We are thinking on other lines,” said creative director and scriptwriter of the serial, Leena Gangopadhyay. -----------. Some viewers thought the character would die. -----------. “That is because what happened in ‘Jol Nupur’. -----------. When actors Ronnie Chakraborty and Pijush Ganguly died, they were both in the same serial, and we showed the characters, too, died But we can’t do that here. -----------. With so much of media coverage, people know what’s happened to Vikram,” Gangopadhyay said. -----------. In fact, she reportedly planned to link events from Vikram’s real life to the screenplay. -----------. “In the script, someone would break the news that Anurag had had an accident. -----------. While the car was found, he was untraceable,” she said. -----------. Dialogues were being written to build the anxiety over searching Anurag. -----------. So, will the crash be shown on Rashbehari Avenue? -----------. “No, we are showing the accident on Durgapur Expressway,” she said. -----------. In fact, two days after his accident, Vikram himself had apparently spoken to Gangopadhyay, expressing his apprehension if he would be able to ever work again. -----------. The question rose because he was aware of the problem of episode-banking that serial-makers faced. -----------. He knew that if an episode was not ready, there could not be a repeat telecast of an earlier episode. -----------. Unlike in other industries—where someone else could replace the person concerned in an emergency to fill in the blank—a “temporary stand-in” could not take on an actor’s role. -----------. So, even Gangopadhyay hoped once Vikram recovered from the trauma of the crash, he would be able to face the camera again. -----------. Fortunately, Gangopadhyay said, ‘Icche Nodi’ had a bank of seven episodes, though usually, it was restricted to merely two. -----------. So, the serial could run for seven days till next Friday before they might face any problems, she added. -----------.  ============.

The fatal accident killed model and TV host Sonika Chauhan and left her friend, Vikram Chatterjee, who was in the driver’s seat, severely injured. -----------. But even a week after the mishap, though the police claim a thorough investigation is underway, there remains more questions than answers. -----------. Witnesses have come out and made startling claims. -----------. Vikram, they say, was indeed drinking through that night — starting around 9.30 pm and lasting till 3.30 am. -----------. When CT got in touch with those who were with the duo that night, the versions were contradictory. -----------. 1. -----------. Where were Sonika and Vikram from 2.15 am to 3.30 am (when the accident allegedly happened)?2. -----------. Why didn’t Sonika, a driver herself, not propose to drive the car if Vikram was drinking all night and allegedly driving the car at breakneck speed?3. -----------. Why was the CCTV footage from Rashbehari Avenue not taken into account to validate whether another car really came across from the other side?4. -----------. Was a blood alcohol test done on Vikram? -----------. Where are the reports?5. -----------. Why was the video of Vikram drinking not produced before the police the day after the mishap?6. -----------. Sonika stays in Hastings and Vikram, in Kasba. -----------. Where was their car heading and where were they coming from?Pranay Vaidya, who bumped into Sonika and Vikram at a nightclub around 1.30 am, remembers Vikram drinking although he stresses on visual proof to validate his claim. -----------. “I hugged Sonika and I had no idea whether Vikram was accompanying her. -----------. I met him a little later. -----------. I clearly remember one thing — Sonika wasn’t drunk that night.” Another source, on terms of anonymity, shared that Sonika too was drinking that night. -----------. Was this why she wasn’t behind the wheel and trusted Vikram instead? -----------. Why didn’t she come back with her boyfriend Shaheb Bhattacherjee despite being asked to?The questions are aplenty but answers are few. -----------. Video evidences clearly show Vikram drinking that night. -----------.

After a hard day’s work, rickshaw puller Kalua Singh was sleeping outside a photocopy shop on Tara Road when the sound of squealing tyres woke him up. -----------. This was followed by an ear-splitting crash. -----------. Staying a few metres away from the accident site, he was the first one to reach the spot in the wee hours of April 29. -----------. It’s the accident that killed model-anchor Sonika Chauhan and had Vikram Chatterjee at the wheel that fateful night. -----------. “It was 3.25 am when I was woken up by the noise that could be heard even from Gariahat; it was that loud. -----------. The car, I am certain, was coming at a high speed. -----------. Within seconds, the man (Vikram) came out of the car from the other side and dragged a lady out. -----------. He made her lie on the middle of the main road and screamed, ‘Sahajyo korun, baba’. -----------. I heard him saying, ‘Meri biwi mar gayi’, but things were happening so fast that I can’t confirm his exact words,” he said. -----------. The girl, said Kalua, was bleeding from her mouth while there were no bruises or cuts to be seen. -----------. “I thought she was dead because something had hit her chest from the impact. -----------. The man was bleeding from all over and his shirt was stained. -----------. He was crying and asked me to find him a cab,” recalled Kalua. -----------. “A local cabbie had stopped as four-five people gathered. -----------. We asked the taxi driver if he would take them to the hospital and he agreed,” said Kalua. -----------. The rickshaw puller admitted that not a minute was lost in the process. -----------. “The man said, ‘Hum ko Ruby le ke chaliye’ and that’s what the taxi driver did. -----------. Once they left, within minutes, the police came. -----------. They took my name as an eyewitness, but did not record my statement. -----------. In the car, I could see a few phones lying, apart from a wallet and a big handbag. -----------. I did not see the man make a single call,” he said. -----------. Three days after the accident, a few men had come to enquire and they claimed to be from Sonika’s side. -----------. “They asked me what had happened that night and I explained it to them. -----------. The only thing I am scared of is a police inquiry. -----------. I am a poor man and don’t want any harm,” he requested as he agreed to pose for a picture. -----------. A sweeper, who refused to be named, also corroborated the facts. -----------. “I was on the pavement that night. -----------. Suddenly, with a loud noise, a white car rammed into the concrete structure some 20 metres from me. -----------. I found the right side (driver’s side) of the vehicle smashed and a man was struggling to come out. -----------. I opened the left door and saw a severely injured lady,” he recalled. -----------. When Vikram asked for a cab, the sweeper and his associates got busy. -----------. “The taxi was waiting for a passenger and I convinced him to cancel the booking,” he added. -----------. When the sweeper asked Vikram to go to Shishumangal Hospital, he screamed, “Ruby chalo! -----------. Ruby chalo,” to the driver. -----------. After around an hour, the driver came back and met the sweeper and said that the girl was probably dead and that he was not feeling well. -----------. “He was in a state of shock and said he wanted to go home. -----------. Since then, I haven’t seen him,” he told us.1. -----------. Sahajyo korun, baba2. -----------. Meri biwi mar gayi3. -----------. Ruby chalo, Ruby chalo1. -----------. Vikram Chatterjee’s sedan, which was travelling at a high speed, hit a guard rail ahead of Lake Mall first (now bent owing to the massive impact) and turned around sideways.2. -----------. Even going sideways, the car did not slow down much though the brakes were already engaged. -----------. This indicates the car was travelling at high speed. -----------. 3. -----------. As it turned, the front of the car hit a jewellery store and the rear, the cemented bottom of a concrete structure in front of it. -----------. It is possible that owing to the rotational force, the airbags didn’t engage. -----------. 4. -----------. The explosive sound in the end of the impact was that of the car touching down on the ground after a partial rollover that also shook the entire store up.5. -----------. The impact buckled the C pillar of the car towards the inside.6. -----------. When the car finally came to a rest, it was facing towards Gariahat — the direction it was initially coming from. -----------.  ============.

It claimed that there was no negligence on the part of the driver and requested the court to dismiss the claim. -----------. The judge, after hearing both the counsels pointed out that the spot panchanama reveals the width of one side road was about 35 to 40 feet. -----------. Thus, inspite of sufficient width, the driver of minibus drove to the extreme left side of the road and dashed the girl and her mother. -----------. Thus, the contention of the claimant is corroborated by the police papers on record. -----------. After scrutinizing the medical papers and all relevant documents including the legal papers the compensation was finalized by the tribunal at Rs 22.35 lakh. -----------. Hence, the judge directed the owner of the minibus Anant Waghule and the insurance company to make the payment jointly along with the interest at 8% per annum till the date of realization. -----------.  ============.

The friends had been up till 4am discussing about the paper they had to appear for on Monday. -----------. Ritu left home in a hurry drinking only half a cup of tea. -----------. “Someone had told them that the exam centre was located on the outskirts of the city and they would have to leave early to reach in time. -----------. We agreed to let her go with her friends since they had planned to travel by hired cabs, but they seemed to have changed their minds midway,” said her father Makhan Lal. -----------. Lal had left for work in Gurgaon when he received a call about his daughter being involved in an accident. -----------. “I was shocked to hear that she was travelling with so many people in a car. -----------. She left home in Patel Nagar after booking a cab on an App. -----------. I thought she had gone to her exam centre until someone informed me that she was admitted in a hospital in Mangolpuri,” he said. -----------. Doctors said she suffocated to death as the others, who were unconscious, fell on her. -----------. Ritu was the brightest among her sisters and Lal had hoped that she would bring laurels to the family. -----------. “During her last-minute preparations on Sunday night, I asked her to rest. -----------. But she told me that she needed to score good marks. -----------. Before leaving she left a text saying she wanted to have parantha. -----------. That was the last we heard from her,” he said. -----------. Sanchit’s father, Raj Kumar, an administrator’s PS at Lady Hardinge hospital, had taken leave from work to help him prepare for the examinations. -----------. “Our hopes have been dashed. -----------. He was a single child and I had hoped that he would own a business someday. -----------. If we had known that they would be going in one car to Narela, we would have stopped them,” said Kumar sitting outside the Sanjay Gandhi hospital mortuary. -----------. Rajat’s father has a utensils business in Punjabi Bagh. -----------. He had bought the car after his son got admission in the college. -----------.

Drunk driving, speeding and poor adherence to traffic rules triggered the surge in the number of fatal road accidents in Pune region on national and state highways, as well as expressway and other roads, in April, which saw the highest number of fatal accidents (179) this year (see box). -----------. Statistics available with the state highway police reveal that between January and April, 736 people were killed in highway accidents and 75% of these were reportedly caused by human error. -----------. The data related to 11 districts -Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Osmanabad and Latur -revealed that in 2017, more than 100 accidents occurred in each month on various state and national highways. -----------. As many as 840 people were injured in these accidents. -----------. State highway police officials attributed factors such as road condition, vehicular density and traffic load to the accidents. -----------. “However, 75% of the accidents occurred due to human errors such as not following rules, flouting speed regulations and careless and drunk driving,“ an official said. -----------. Ranjit Gadgil, programme director at Parisar, said “overspeeding“ was one of the biggest factors leading to the highway accidents. -----------. “Besides, many vehicles in India are not built as per international standards and, thus, are not quite safe. -----------. Vehicles abroad have safety featu res such as air bags. -----------. Also, the structural integrity of a car should be such that when an accident occurs, there is minimal impact on the driver and passengers,“ he added. -----------.

The officer added that the truck driver fled from the spot after the accident.“We have launched a man hunt for the accused,“ he said. -----------. According to the officer, the accident happened around 2am at Dhangarwadi junction, located about 12km from Ahmednagar city.“Prima facie, the probe revealed that the SUV, while on its way to Buldana from Yavat in Pune district, had halted at the Dhangarwadi junction. -----------. The truck, which was travelling towards Ahmednagar from Aurangabad at a high speed, knocked down the SUV ,“ he said. -----------. The officer explained that there is a slight turn on the road at Dhangarwadi junction. -----------. “We suspect that the SUV's driver had stopped at the junction because he wanted to cross the road. -----------.

A freak accident at railway crossing gate 92 near Partur, a few minutes before passing of Manmad-Dharmabad-Marathwada Express on late Tuesday evening, sparked rumours. -----------. While locals and railway activists were of the view that major tragedy was averted as a mishap involving a tanker took place just before the train arrived at the railway crossing gate, railway authorities have ruled out any such speculations. -----------. Detailing about the incident, A K Sinha, divisional railway manager for Nanded division, said, “A tanker had hit the railway crossing gate from one side when it was descending.”“The driver of the tanker was apparently in inebriated condition and ran away from the spot. -----------. His reckless driving not only caused damage to one of the railings, but also injured a girl waiting at the crossing,” he said. -----------. Sinha said, “The railway crossing in question was installed with inter-locking gates, which he said served as a fool-proof safety measure.”The key feature of the inter-locking gates is that they do not allow railway signals to become green unless the railing on either side of the crossing gate are tightly fit. -----------. As soon as the accident took place, railway signal turned red. -----------. Accordingly, a caution signal was sent to the station master who slowed down the speed of three trains, including Marathwada Express, he said. -----------. The freak mishap eventually resulted in detention of Marathwada Express and two other trains for nearly two minutes. -----------. The South Central Railway has launched a complaint against concerned tanker driver with the Government Railway Police, which has initiated a manhunt based on the registration number of vehicle. -----------.  ============. Two auto drivers suffered minor injuries when an auto trolley was hit by a cab from the rear at APPA junction near Narsingi on Wednesday. -----------. The injured were treated as out-patients at a local hospital, police said. -----------. To avoid hitting a parked auto on the road, the auto trolley behind it swerved to the right. -----------. A cab, which was coming behind the trolley, hit it. -----------. As part of a domino effect, the trolley hit the stationary auto. -----------. "Luckily, no one died in the accident. -----------. The accident could have been avoided had the auto driver not parked the vehicle on the road,'' Narsingi inspector P Ramchander Rao said. -----------. Police said both the autos suffered damage and police rushed to the spot on finding out about the accident to shift the injured to hospital. -----------. In the last 10 days, this was the second accident near the Outer Ring Road. -----------. In the previous case, three Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) alumni died in a road accident at Tukkuguda on the ORR. -----------. With increasing road accidents and insufficient enforcement on the ORR, Cyberabad police will be using service additional speed guns from Thursday to track speeding vehicles. -----------. Overspeeding is among thr primary causes for accidents, especially on this road in the city. -----------. The Cyberabad police commissioner Sandeep Shandilya will also give four new ORR patrol vehicles, the speed laser guns and 13 breath analyzers to the traffic wing at the ORR toll plaza at Nanakramguda on Thursday. -----------. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has procured and given the equipment to the police as ORR was built by it and the HMDA oversees it. -----------. Currently, the Cyberabad police have two speed guns and two patrolling vehicles. -----------. Last week, the Rachakonda police pressed into service three new speed guns for the ORR stretch in its limits after a spate of recent accidents. -----------. tnn -----------.  ============. A day after a bus carrying 30 Char Dham pilgrims from Indore fell into the Bhagirathi river in Uttarkashi district, rescue teams have recovered 24 bodies on Wednesday. -----------. In an intensive operation that lasted for over 15 hours, rescuers on rafts were able to recover bodies of 24 victims while search is still on for one missing devotee. -----------. Dadanpal, superintendent of police (Uttarkashi), said, “We have managed to recover 24 bodies. -----------. Of the six injured pilgrims, four were airlifted to Dehradun on Wednesday morning for treatment. -----------. We are continuing the search operation as one person, Tej Sharan, who was believed to be on the bus, is still missing.”  Thirty pilgrims from Betma and Hatod in Indore district were returning from Gangotri on the bus when it fell into a 250-metre-deep gorge between Nalupani and Dharasu in Uttarkashi district. -----------. The victims were part of a larger group of 57 pilgrims which had started its journey from Indore on May 12. -----------. On Wednesday, one National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and two State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) teams combed the river for bodies on two rafts. -----------. The teams were able to fish out seven bodies from the gushing waters. -----------. Seventeen bodies had been recovered by police from the banks of the river late night on Tuesday. -----------. Senior police officials said that the bodies have been identified and sent to Jolly Grant Hospital in Dehradun. -----------. Urban development minister Madan Kaushik also reached Uttarkashi on Wednesday to meet the injured. -----------. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Rs 2 lakh each for the next of kin of those killed in the accident in Uttarakhand. -----------. He also sanctioned Rs 50,000 from the PM National Relief Fund (PMNRF) for those injured. -----------.  ============. Taking a serious view of a tribunal for its failure to look at the larger impact of the death of a young breadwinner of a family , Justice N Balayogi of the Hyderabad High Court has set aside the order of the tribunal that granted a compensation of `2.5 lakh to the parents and other members of the family of the deceased. -----------. The court increased the compensation amount to `14.88 lakh. -----------. The judge directed the APSRTC to pay the amount along with an interest of 7.5 per cent from November 2006. -----------. The judge was dealing with an appeal filed by the aggrieved parents and other relatives of Sheik Karim of Visakhapatnam who was killed when an RTC bus mowed him down on September 13, 2006. -----------. Karim completed his training at an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) and landed a job as kalasi in Saudi Arabia's National Contracting Company Ltd. -----------. He was sending `10,000 every month to his parents. -----------. When he had come to his native Vizag on vacation, he met with an accident and lost his life. -----------. The motor accidents tribunal in Visakhapatnam made an erroneous estimate of the salary drawn by the victim and decided on the compensation accordingly . -----------. The parents felt let down by the tribunal and moved the high court seeking higher compensation. -----------. Justice Balayogi went through the records and concluded that Karim was a skilled worker. -----------. Had he been alive, he would have served for another 36 years and would have risen in career. -----------. The judge found fault with the tribunal for relying on baseless material and presumptions and assumptions for its unrealistic conclusions. -----------. The record of remittances through bank as shown by the parents of the deceased proves the fact that he was sending `10,000 every month from Saudi Arabia, Justice Balayogi said. -----------. The judge termed as perverse the observations made by the tribunal in its judgment that workers in Saudi Arabia were suffering a lot from lack of employment. -----------. “You cannot import your personal knowledge into the judgment without there being any pleadings by the parties,“ the judge told the tribunal. -----------.  ============.  +++++++++++++++++++. A Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, while awarding a total compensation of a around Rs 4.12 lakh to a man who lost three toes after being knocked down by a tempo in 2012, accepted that he will have to face social stigma. -----------. The tribunal while breaking down the components under which compensation was awarded has allowed Rs 50,000 to be paid for “loss of amenities” in life due to this stigma and restriction of movements. -----------. The other heads under which the compensation was granted included, medical expenses, special diet and conveyance, pain and suffering, disability and loss of income. -----------. The total amount of Rs 2.87 lakh was to be paid along with an interest of 9% per annum from the date of filing the application. -----------. This brought the compensation amount to around Rs 4.12 lakh. -----------. The 40-year-old victim had submitted the application seeking compensation on March 7, 2012. -----------. He said that on February 10, 2012 around 4.30 pm he was riding his motorcycle on the Sion Trombay road when a tempo came from the opposite direction and dashed against him. -----------. He said that he sustained severe injuries and was admitted to Shatabdi Hospital. -----------. He was then shifted to Sion hospital where he was admitted until February 22, 2012 . -----------. The victim said that after being operated, three of his toes on the right foot had to be amputated. -----------. While the owner of the tempo, SM Packaging, remained absent before the tribunal, the insurance company, ICICI Lombard Gen Insurance Co Ltd said that it was not liable to indemnify the owner as the driver of the offending vehicle did not hold a valid driving licence on the date of accident. -----------. It said that this amounted to a breach of the terms and conditions of the policy. -----------. The tribunal however said that the insurance company did not examine any witness from either the RTO department or otherwise to prove the defence. -----------. Further it observed that the spot panchanama also showed that there was sufficient space for the driver of the tempo to take necessary precaution on spotting the victim. -----------. “But it appears that he failed to take proper care and precaution and to control his vehicle and as a result the applicant was injured,” the tribunal held. -----------.  ============. A post-midnight accident left six buffaloes dead and 18 injured on Outer Ring Road in south Delhi, bringing the morning traffic on Thursday almost to a standstill. -----------. A truck bearing a Rajasthan registration plate and loaded with the animals overturned on a diversion loop heading towards the Hauz Khas flyover at around 1am. -----------. The driver fled from the spot, leaving the animals stranded on the road.“When we reached the spot, we found that some of the buffalos had died due to the fall from the flyover, while others, whose horns were tied together, had been severely injured. -----------. The driver and cleaner had deserted the truck on the road,” said Ishwar Singh, DCP (South). -----------. Police arranged food, water and treatment for the buffaloes, but they also had to barricade the road to protect the animals. -----------. However, the cops were unable to remove the carcasses from the road. -----------. “We moved the dead animals to the side of the road,” said a police officer, adding that they had informed the South Delhi Municipal Corporation about the incident. -----------. Help arrived only after 11am, and all this while the cops had the tough task of keeping the animals safe while allowing movement of traffic. -----------. Traffic jams choked Outer Ring Road for nearly three hours, the flow of vehicles hampered by the crowd of curious people as well as the constricted road. -----------. The streets around Hauz Khas and Malviya Nagar too were crammed as rush-hour commuters tried to find detours out of the mess. -----------. Apparently, a sharp turn on the flyover created by a diversion necessitated by Delhi Metro construction work was behind the accident. -----------. Traffic police officers admitted that this was not the first time a vehicle had overturned there. -----------. The absence of proper warning signs caused speeding vehicles to suddenly encounter the unexpected turn. -----------. Three incidents of the sort have taken place at the spot this year. -----------. “A few days ago, a truck carrying garments had similarly overturned at the bend,” a police officer said. -----------. DCP Singh said that a case of rash and negligent driving under Section 279 of the Indian Penal Code had been registered. -----------. Additional charges under Section 429 of IPC for killing or maiming cattle had also been filed. -----------. The injured buffaloes were taken to an animal welfare home in north Delhi. -----------.  ============. An accident on Thursday on the Vallarpadam container road claimed one more life when a car rammed a parked container. -----------.

The injured has been identified as Amal Roy (30). -----------. The accident occurred while the duo were travelling from Ernakulam to Chalakkudy after purchasing clothes for Roy, whose engagement was supposed to be held on Friday in Chalakkudy. -----------. Amal worked in the Middle East and had return ed to Kerala for his engagement. -----------. A series of accidents have been occurring at the container road. -----------. Several people have got injured and many others have lost their lives as vehicles crashed into containers parked illegally on the road. -----------. The BPCL had started work on setting up a parking facility for containers in Vallarpadom last year but it has not been able complete it so far. -----------. The district administration had asked the BPCL to speed up the work since accidents became a routine affair due to the illegal parking of containers along the International Container Transhipment Terminal Road. -----------. Since the parking facility is coming up on reclaimed land, BPCL officials took time to strengthen the land. -----------. Earlier, officials said they were planning to complete the parking facility by May 25. -----------. The parking space will have facility to park around 200 containers at a time. -----------.  ============. Three persons died and five others were injured when a luxury bus collided with another bus near Jambua Bridge on National Highway 8 on Thursday morning. -----------. The accident happened when one of the buses was parked by the roadside near the bridge at about 4.30 am. -----------.

Three passengers travelling in the parked bus suffered injuries, said Makarpura police sub-inspector, V N Mahida. -----------. “One of the deceased has been identified as Shivgiri Goswami. -----------. We have contacted the transport firm to track down families of the other two. -----------. We may get their details by Friday morning,” Mahida told TOI. -----------. Investigating officials are also unsure if one of the deceased was driver of the speeding bus. -----------. NH 8 that passes from the outskirts of the city witnesses several accidents throughout the year. -----------. Intersections to the city’s entry have higher risk of accidents as vehicles take turn at a high speed. -----------. City police commissioner Manoj Sashidhar told TOI, “I have asked a team of experts to study the area and see if we need to do traffic engineering to avoid accidents. -----------. Some professors from M S University too will help us.” -----------.  ============. A luxury bus going towards Goa met with a fatal accident on the Mumbai-Goa highway in Ratnagiri district on early Friday morning, killing at least two persons and injuring 21 others. -----------. A police official at Ratnagiri district head-office informed TOI that the accident happened a little after 4.10am on the main road at Agwe village, which is under the jurisdiction of Sawarde local police. -----------. The death toll is likely to rise as the heavy vehicle fell a few feet down from the elevated road. -----------. "The bus driver was negotiating a turning on the highway, but somehow lost control and the bus fell a few feet off the road, leading to the casualties and injuries," said an on-duty official at Sawarde police station. -----------.

Medical tests conducted on Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus driver Ramesh Sahdev Kamble, who lost control of the vehicle in Kolhapur on Wednesday evening, have revealed that he has brain tumour. -----------. Incidentally, Kamble was driving the same bus that was driven by Santosh Mane in 2012 in Pune, when he mowed down nine people. -----------. Two people were killed and 10 others were injured when Kamble rammed into several vehicles on a busy chowk on Wednesday evening. -----------. He has been booked for causing death by negligence and rash driving. -----------. Jaiprakash Ramanand, dean of the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) civil hospital, said they had conducted a CT scan that revealed tumour of the size of 4x3cm on the left part of Kamble's brain. -----------. They have to perform MRI scan to find out exact details of the brain tumour and its location. -----------. "Kamble was not aware of this. -----------. The only symptom he had from last eight months was constant headaches. -----------. He might have lost consciousness for some time when the road accident occurred. -----------. His heart functioning is normal," Ramanand said. -----------. Interestingly, Kamble had undergone medical check-up in January. -----------. Then, the reports were "normal" and he was declared fit. -----------. Divisional transport officer D B Kadam said, "We conduct regular medical tests of drivers. -----------.
